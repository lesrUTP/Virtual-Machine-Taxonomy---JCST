	In recent years virtualization technologies have been widely used to provide important benefits to organizations such as isolation, the division of resources, consolidation capacity, security, support facilities, and administration \cite{Varasteh2017}.
	Virtualization also brings direct financial benefits to organizations in terms of return on investment (ROI), and reductions in the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the computer systems hardware \cite{Solis2014}, \cite{AbdElRahem2016}. Another reason that has motivated the adoption of virtualization technologies in business environments has to do with the environmental impact. 
	%This involves the use of smaller amounts of energy to maintain operations related to information technology (IT), as is the case of server virtualization in data centers. 
	Less energy is required to maintain a set of virtualized services as they can typically share fewer physical machines (server virtualization in data centers). This idea with an environmental dimension is generally called \textit{Green Computing} \cite {Thathera2015, Ranjith2017, Jing2011}. Today, this has a predominant role in safeguarding the environment and it is even considered as an aspect of competitiveness in many parts of the world when participating in selection processes in public and private bidding processes.
	
	% Virtualization technologies have been able to consolidate mainly in the last two decades, \cite{Kampert2010}. 
	%This trend has led many organizations to start implementing these technologies, generating different types and approaches for the virtualization technologies developed. 
	 %Part of this situation is due to the fact that documents on technical procedures abound in the available documentation. 
	 %However, there are indeed fewer publications about the classification of virtualization types. 
	 %This situation makes it difficult to unify criteria on the denomination and the conceptual boundaries of the existing and emerging elements of this set of technologies.

	%Virtualization technologies have revolutionized data centers in the last two decades, \cite{Kampert2010} and many variations of virtualization technologies have been developed. However in this vast and rapidly changing landscape of technologies offerings, there have been fewer publications on the classification of virtualization types. As virtualization technologies reach a level of maturity, we have an opportunity to look back and propose a set of criteria and boundaries to help explain and classify this set of technologies.
	

	%JNM Cubren 7 taxonomías diferentes. Creo que eso es mucho. En cambio, podría decir que ha habido varios intentos diferentes para una taxonomía y que este documento los revisa y compara y recomienda uno que aborde las debilidades en las taxonomías existentes.
	 
	%JNM - Muchas de mis ediciones son pequeñas sugerencias para reformular o enfocar el texto. Mi mayor sugerencia es ser muy claro sobre lo que es diferente en su nueva taxonomía. Este párrafo es un lugar perfecto para hacer eso.
	
	%JNM Enfatice aqui que está incluyendo las dos dimensiones principales ((Type of VM) and (Abstraction Level)) en un diagrama. 
	
	%LESR - old - Before JNM
	%%The previously published studies referenced in this document propose various taxonomies and models of existing virtualization technologies. 
	
	%JNM Si rellena esta frase me encantaría leer este parrafo otra vez.
	%In this paper, we present a taxonomy that improves and unifies previous work in X key ways: 1) and 2)....
	%I am not sure what you mean by "focus on the integration of resources"
	%Likewise, a taxonomy of virtual machines is proposed, which is focus on the integration of resources and combines different taxonomic studies. 
	
	%Relative to previous studies we also classify systems developed in more recent years.
	%We also include a taxonomic-key diagram that we believe will facilitate the selection of virtualization technologies based on our proposed taxonomy.
	
	%LESR - new
    Virtualization technologies have revolutionized data centers in the last two decades and this has favored the development of variations in virtualization technologies \cite{Kampert2010}. In the same way, in the literature is possible identified several attempts have been made to establish classification schemes for this type of technologies, hence, in this document, we include as elements to highlight: first a revision and compilation of classification schemes of virtual machines, second a new virtual machine taxonomy is proposed, which responds to the weaknesses found in the revised taxonomies, and finally includes a taxonomic key diagram, created to facilitate the selection of virtualization technologies according to the proposed new taxonomy. The taxonomy that we present improves and unifies the previous works in the following three ways: 1) Combined approaches: shows the approach of the virtual machine type (approach: Type of VM, see Figure \ref{fig:twoApproaches}a ) simultaneously with the approach that indicates the level of abstraction in which it has place virtualization (approach: Abstraction Level, see Figure \ref{fig:twoApproaches}b), this combination of approaches seeks to favor the teaching and learning processes of this type of technology, 2) Update: includes examples of virtualization technologies that have recently emerged, and 3) choice of technology: when using the taxonomic key diagram, it is sought to facilitate the process to select virtualization technologies in either academic or productive environments.
