	\subsection{Types of virtual machines by \textit{Xiao-Feng}}
	
	In the book called "\textit{Advanced Design and Implementation of Virtual Machines}" by Xiao-Feng in 2016 \cite{Xiao-Feng2016}, there is no graph describing the types of classification of virtual machines, however, the existence of four types of virtual machines like this is indicated:
	
	\textbf{Type 1}. Full instruction set architecture (ISA) virtual machine provides a full computer system's ISA emulation or virtualization. 
	
	Guest operating system and applications can run on the top of the virtual machine as on an actual computer (e.g., VirtualBox, QEMU, and XEN).
